# Intertidal

## Overview

This repository contains scripts needed to push survey data to the WDFW shellfish database, and once all data are present, generate harvest estimates for intertidal clam and oyster harvest for public beaches in Puget Sound, and adjoining waters. Methods used to generate harvest estimates for these beaches are defined in [Strom and Bradbury, 2007](https://wdfw.wa.gov/publications/00944). 

## Folder structure

The scripts are organized in numbered folders to facilitate a workflow I've found useful in the past to organize, load, and analyze the data needed to produce annual harvest estimates. 

## Permissions

In order to use the scripts in this repository you **must** first be granted permissions to the shellfish database. STOPPED HERE !!!!!!


After the application is launched you will then need to enter the password for the database into the login panel. There is no need to manually enter a user name. The user name field is set by default to be the same as the user name of the person that logged into the computer,  and can not be edited. This is by design. It allows recording the user name to the database `created_by` or `modified_by` fields anytime new entries, updates, or edits are committed. 

### In case of failure  

If after installing the application, it crashes, or fails to load, navigate to the `out.txt` folder in the App directory: `C:\Documents\Apps\Baseline\out.txt`. The `out.txt` file will log the first fatal error encountered. Please include this information when reporting the error.

In case of failure, you may also need to kill any active `R` processes using Windows Task Manager. Click `Ctrl-Alt-Delete` to open Task Manager. Then in the `Processes` tab, look for any processes named `R for Windows front-end` or `R for Windows terminal front-end`. You can right-click on these and select `End task` to terminate the process.
